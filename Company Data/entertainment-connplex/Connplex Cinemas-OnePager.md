## SWOT

### Strengths
- Connplex's total income surged 59% to ₹96.78 crores in FY25 from ₹60.83 crores in FY24.
- PAT experienced 365% growth, rising from ₹4.09 crores in FY24 to ₹19.01 crores in FY25.
- ROE is 77% in Mar-2025, a growth of 1.7% YoY, demonstrating efficient equity utilization.

### Weaknesses
- Cinema revenues slipped 1.9% in 2024 to $1.5 billion, expected to recover to $1.7 billion by 2029.
- Advertising income across multiplex chains is below Rs1,000 crore, shy of pre-pandemic levels.
- Occupancy is down 25-30% due to increased screen count rather than per-screen productivity.

### Opportunities
- India's entertainment & media industry is expected to reach INR 412656 Cr by 2025, at 10.75% CAGR.
- Multiplex revenue to grow 10-15% in fiscal 2025 due to screen additions and higher footfalls.
- India cinema advertising market to reach USD 210 Million by 2034, with 5.89% CAGR.

### Threats
- OTT platforms are reducing cinema footfall, impacting advertising demand and revenue.
- Single-screen cinemas are struggling with a 20-30% drop in earnings.
- Box office revenue fell to ₹188 billion in 2024, a 6% decrease from Rs200 billion.
