## SWOT

### Strengths
- Extensive experience of the promoters and established market position: Kalyani Forge Limited (KFL) benefits from the four-decade experience of its promoters in the domestic forging and machining industry. They possess a strong understanding of market dynamics and have healthy relationships with reputed original equipment manufacturers in the auto segment. KFL serves a diversified clientele, with the top five customers contributing to 30-35% of total revenue.
- Moderate financial risk profile: The financial risk profile of KFL is moderate, supported by a sizeable net worth of Rs 81.3 crore as of March 31, 2024. Key metrics include a gearing ratio of 0.75 times and total outside liabilities to tangible net worth at 1.46 times. The interest coverage ratio stood at 2.6 times, indicating sufficient earnings to cover interest obligations.

### Weaknesses
- Exposure to cyclicality in the auto sector: KFL is significantly impacted by the cyclicality of the automotive sector, which contributes 70-80% of revenue. The operating margin is susceptible to volatility in raw material prices, which can affect profitability. Intense competition from auto ancillary manufacturers may constrain scalability and pricing power.
- Large working capital requirement: The gross current assets (GCAs) have increased to 199 days as of March 31, 2024, from 175 days the previous year. This increase is attributed to a rise in payables. Despite improvements in the collection of receivables, the working capital cycle may remain stretched over the medium term.

### Opportunities
- Potential for revenue growth: KFL has the opportunity to increase revenue by over 25% annually, provided that it maintains stable operating margins above 7%. The continued focus on profitable business segments and favorable changes in product mix represent avenues for growth.
- Enhanced operational efficiency: The company has implemented cost-control measures and improvements in operational efficiency, which may lead to further enhancements in the operating margin in the medium term.

### Threats
- Volatility in raw material prices: The company's operating margin is vulnerable to fluctuations in raw material prices, which can impact profitability. Any increase in prices is usually passed onto customers with a time lag, creating potential cash flow challenges.
- Declining revenue or operating margin: Any decline in revenue or operating margins could lead to cash accruals falling below Rs 10 crore, which would weaken the financial stability of KFL. This could also be exacerbated by large, debt-funded capital expenditures or acquisitions.
